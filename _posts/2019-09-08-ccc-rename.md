I've been pretty happy with the name `ccc` as a shortcut for `Cert Central Client`, but I need to think a new name for a few reasons:

- Cert Central is already being used by other certificate related orgs. It will be hard to compete with them in SEO terms
- The domain x509.online has expired and based on the current usage (almost none) I've decided to do not renew the domain and use the default azurewebsites.net at [X509Online](https://x509online.azurewebsites.net/)
- X509Online is probably the next name for this project, but I don't have a good name for CLI tool
